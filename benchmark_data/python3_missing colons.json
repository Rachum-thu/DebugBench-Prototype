As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character.

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n\\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\\n            pre[course].append(p)\\n        \\n        taken = set()\\n\\n        def dfs(course):\\n            if not pre[course]:\\n                return True\\n            \\n            if course in taken:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            taken.add(course)\\n\\n            for p in pre[course]:\\n                if not dfs(p): return False\\n            \\n            pre[course] = []\\n            return True\\n        \\n        for course in range(numCourses):\\n            if not dfs(course):\\n                return False\\n\\n        return True\\n```",

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem.
